1. Write algorithm, flowchart & program for below question.

BMI Calculator:
Build a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) 
based on the user's weight and height input. 
Then, categorize the BMI into 
underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese.

Hint:
BMI = weight / (height * height)
BMI Measurement	Weight Category
Below 18.5	Underweight
18.5 – 24.9	Normal weight
25.0 – 29.9	Overweight
30.0 and above	Obese


2. Write algorithm, flowchart & program for below question.

Implement a calculator that takes two numbers and an operator as input. 
Use a switch statement to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
or division based on the operator.


3. Write algorithm, flowchart & program for below question.
